## Files

- Main

  - proj.ipynb: Contains code for parts 1 through 5

- Extra Credit

  - all_forms.ipynb: Condensed function for all three formulations
  - edge_solving_time.png: Graph visualizing the relation between Gurobi solving time and number of edges in the network
  - node_solving_time.png: Graph visualizing the relation between Gurobi solving time and number of nodes in the network
  - time_results3.csv: Record of solving times for different topologies
  - topologies3.ipynb: Code to run formulations on various graph sizes

## How to run code

- Main

  - Run proj.ipynb for all three formulations
  - Run visualizations.ipynb to retrieve graphs

- Extra Credit

  - Run topologies3.ipynb and the visualizations will be at the bottom
